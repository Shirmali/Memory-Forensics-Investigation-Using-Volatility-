# üß† Memory Forensics Investigation using Volatility

## üîç Project Overview

This project showcases a complete **memory forensics investigation** conducted on a compromised Windows machine using the **Volatility Framework**. Memory forensics plays a vital role in modern incident response, especially in identifying fileless malware, privilege escalation attempts, reverse shells, and persistence mechanisms that reside entirely in RAM.

The challenge was conducted via [TryHackMe's Memory Forensics Room](https://tryhackme.com/room/memoryforensics) and simulated a real-world memory analysis scenario involving malware, suspicious processes, and network activity.

## üéØ Objectives

- Extract forensic artifacts from a Windows memory dump
- Identify suspicious or malicious processes
- Analyze in-memory indicators of compromise (IoCs)
- Reconstruct attacker behavior from memory traces
- Practice using Volatility in an incident response workflow
